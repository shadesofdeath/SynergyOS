# What is SynergyOS ?

SynergyOS removes all the negative disadvantages of Windows that reduce gaming performance and is presented to you as a modified version of Windows. If you have a very old pc or a low-end computer, SynergyOS will put a smile on your face.

SynergyOS is designed to reduce system lag, network latency, input lag and keep your system private while maximizing performance.

### **Debloated**

In SynergyOS, Windows, pre-installed applications and other components have been removed. While this may break some compatibility, it drastically reduces the ISO and install size. Functions like Windows Defender and Windows Update have been completely removed. This modification is focused on pure gaming, but is also conveniently used for most business and education applications.
